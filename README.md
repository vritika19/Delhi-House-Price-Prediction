## Project Overview

This repository provides:

- Cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering for housing price data
- Exploratory Data Analysis with meaningful visualizations
- Regression models (e.g., linear regression, random forest) to estimate house prices
- Model evaluation using metrics such as R¬≤, RMSE, and MAE

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Data manipulation: Pandas, NumPy  
- Machine learning: Scikit-learn  
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook or standalone Python script

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/delhi-housing-price-prediction.git
   cd delhi-housing-price-prediction
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run your notebook or the Python script**

```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA.ipynb
```

   Or:

```bash
   python delhi_housing.py
```

## üìä Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using:

* **R¬≤ (Coefficient of Determination)**
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**

These metrics help compare model performance and interpretability.
